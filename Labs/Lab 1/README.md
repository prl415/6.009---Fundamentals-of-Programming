This folder includes solution to the LAB 1 - Image Processing. 
On an Apple Macbook Air M1/16 GB/8C - 8G system 7 tests are done in 27.451s
lab1.py code outputs blacl/white images to reduce the test time but folder also includes code that outputs colorful image.
In addition to the required code, lab1.py also have code for seam carving (very interesting and clever algorithm. Results for colorful image cases have relatively high quality). With a good UI this code can be used as a simple photo editor for simple photo manipulating tasks.
