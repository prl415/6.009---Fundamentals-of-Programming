- This folder contains solution to the Circuit Solver lab
- Basically by using kirchoff laws this code calculates the voltages and currents along each wire of given circuits. Equations created by using kirchoff laws are solved using substitution method
- On an Apple Macbook Air M1/16 GB/8C - 8G system 25 tests are done in 18.904 seconds
- Due to large size of test files, they are uploaded as a zip file
