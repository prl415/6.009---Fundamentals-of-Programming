shortest_path_no_lefts(edges, start, end):
	-Firstly, transformed the inputted graph
	-Then, by using transformed graph remove all of the left turns
	 by using checking cross and dot products
	-At last, by using BFS find the shortest path from start
	 to end if exists
	-Return the found path, if there is no path return None
